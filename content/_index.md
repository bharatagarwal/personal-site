Currently, I'm a Tech Lead at [Qolaba](https://qolaba.ai), and have previously worked at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/atlassian-engineering/cloud-overview) and [Shopify](https://shopify.engineering/scale-performance-testing). I'm also a co-creator of [Mothership](https://mothership.live/case-study), an open-source platform-as-service for small applications.

This is my personal blog, where I share learnings from having been on this planet for 35 years. I've had a unique journey that covers design, career change, neurodivergence, self-education, and had my fair share of triumphs and disappointments along the way.
