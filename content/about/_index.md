I'm a living, breathing human being. This cuts to the core of what I want to talk about, which is maintaining your humanity in a rapidly changing world.

I went to an elite high-school in Delhi, but rebelled against everything and was a lost soul in school. I took a wild-swing and went to architecture school, and spent 6 years figuring out I was not a good fit. I bummed around and slept in tents, tried to learn to code, and then decided I want to be a UX Designer.

I did some part-time work as a UX Designer, and decided that I want to learn to code properly, because no one was implementing my designs. I really enjoyed learning to code, and liked it enough to make that my profession.

In an exploding job market, I joined Atlassian as my first company, blamed everyone by myself for struggling there, and took a break. I joined an online program that was to my liking, and found my limits as a learner -- and subsequently, got diagnosed as neurodivergent.

Chat GPT came out in late 2022, and I felt like I had the tools to handle my detail-obsessiveness.

With psychological -and pharmaceutical-  help, I figured things are under control, and when Shopify made an offer, it seemed like I've got it all figured out. But then, as if on-cue, my life fell into disarray as the company fired me within 6 months of joining them. I decided, AI was the cause of my firing, and joined an AI startup to learn how to work with it.

It's Aug 2025, and I've got a bit of AI fatigue. The way we're talking about people, it seems like everybody's disposable, and I'm beginning to wonder, where do I fit in amongst all of this.

I think there are paths in my journey, where I can pick up learnings, and find something valuable to contribute to the universe. A humanist, techno-enabled, fun, intelligent, kind vision of the future. There has to be a way to make that happen. Get in touch with me, if there's something we can do to bring it to fruition.
