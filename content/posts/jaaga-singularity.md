## Prelude

After graduating from college, I decided that I wanted to return to the the world I used to inhabit as a member of my school computer club, Exun. While sitting in Delhi finishing up a publication I was working on with an architecture firm, I saw a notification for a code camp being conducted near Dharamshala, in a village called Rakkar.


The fact that this was hosted at a hackerspace, and would culminate in HillHacks, made this really exciting for me. In addition, Jaaga was involved. I had seen their 'Creative Sunday Mornings' events with envy for some time, and this felt like the perfect opportunity to make that leap to the tech world.

Programming, however, didn't really work out for me. Instead, I found that I would always end up being involved in discussions relating to design, be it doing wireframes for an in-house social network being developed by MindGreppers, or discussing with Freeman Murray his wild and completely out-there ideas on pallet racks and architecture.


Mind you, this was extremely different from the cab-a/c-honking-dusty hell that was Delhi. We stayed in camping tents for two months, which took a while to adjust to, particularly when it was raining. You have to learn how to peg them down and find a suitable location, such that the trees can break the flow of wind. Once you do that, Quechua tents are a marvel - both in the ease of putting-up and how they manage to stay waterproof in the strongest thunderstorms. The best thing about living like this was the view. Every morning you wake up to a view of the mountains!

HillHacks was lovely experience (more on that some other time). My conversations with other people consolidated my desire to pursue interaction design, and that Bangalore was the best place to be.


## Bangalore

I arrived at the Bangalore airport on 10th August, without a job or a ready portfolio. The first couple of months were a struggle adjusting, and I was haemorrhaging through my savings. Around October, I heard that a new Jaaga Study quarter is starting, and was delighted to see an option to join as a 'Digital Nomad', for 10k INR/month. This meant I could enjoy the environment of the farm while doing my own thing.

There was just an allocated patch of land at the farm when I joined. Only two shipping containers packed with the components of a pallet racking system - 8m tall uprights, 4m span beams, 1m span secondary beams and 8' x 4' plywood sheets. We built the structure ourselves, putting in labour that most of us were not used to. When you build your own space, there is a unique sense of ownership about it. One thing I loved was that we built it in stages, with the cost of iteration almost nothing. You could just lift a beam from it's notches, and move it up or down in increments as small as 3 inches.

Pallet Racks are a warehousing solution, designed to carry the load of boxes carrying inventory, on top of a wooden base (pallet). They allow for minute adjustments in height in order to maximise storage efficiency. The uprights are made out of steel, which has holes punched in and then roll-formed into a U-shaped section. Because of the industrial requirements, these are rated to carry loads in tonnes, thus being very safe to stand, walk, jump around and live on.

Freeman hacked this warehousing system to build liveable space on. Instead of following a single straight line, like a storage shelf would, these are placed adjacent to each other to create a continuous coverage, that can be shaded and stacked. One thing that stands out is that this touches the ground very lightly, with no need for foundations. In fact it's hard to say that there was any structure on the land occupied after everything has been dismantled, because there's nothing permanent about the changes. This is important when you're operating on a nomadic model, and makes it an easier sell to farmers to allow their land to be used.

Jaaga Study's mandate is: Live in nature, do yoga, learn to code. The pallet rack structures fit into this neatly, as there is no notion of walls. In fact it's better for stability to allow the wind to pass through. The only time you're indoors is when you go into your tent to sleep. You're outside the whole day, exercising, cooking, learning together. Over time you end up with an easygoing collegiate kind of atmosphere. In fact the tents serve an important purpose - they become your own personal fortress of solitude.

As my month as a nomad got over, my architecture portfolio was finished, I saw that it would take some time to find and join a design firm full-time. So I offered to help out with developing further applications of this system, and cooked up a title for myself - Designer in Residence.

## Designer-in-Residence

I'd say it was one of those situations where I was in the right place at the right time, because I got the chance to sink my teeth into some juicy projects. The first of these, was a dream project with a dream brief.

**The requirement:** Design for the Burning Man festival.\
**The brief:** Make it as cool as possible.

Freeman's a member at Disorient, a camp at Burning Man where he builds public hang-out spaces with Pallet Racks. This year he intends to take it up a notch, and build residential units

Burning Man takes place in the flat Black Rock Desert of Nevada every year. For one week, an otherwise desolate patch of land becomes a hotbed of activity, and then goes back to being desolate. It’s an example of pop-up architecture, and it’s transience means that people either stay in tents, or bring their shelter with them in the form of Recreational Vehicles (RVs). These, however, are prohibitively expensive, and go somewhat against the do-it-yourself ethos of the festival.

Freeman wants to build residential units that can be used in place of RVs, using pallet racks. These however, have very different requirements to Bangalore. The playa (spanish word for beach, used to describe dry lake beds in the American west such as the Black Rock Desert) can go through heavy duststorms, which means walls became a necessity. The units had to be as comfortable and more cool than RVs to appeal to the average burner, and we set about with the ambition of making it an art piece in itself.

We decided to use foam panels for this as they provide insulation, and covered them with a reflective surface that would reduce heat, and also would gleam like a metal. Disorient’s colour scheme is Pornj (pink and orange), and we used that as a takeoff for designing lasercut plywood ‘trees’, bringing a sense of shrubbery and warmth to the place. Walls makes it vulnerable to shear force, and we improved stability by anchoring to the ground, much like you would anchor a tent.

}}


One thing to note is that Disorient occupies prime real estate at Burning Man, facing the esplanade where the eponymous man burns. So keeping these two factors in mind, we left some open platforms as gifts for the people roaming around the playa, small places to hang out and look onto the madness.
