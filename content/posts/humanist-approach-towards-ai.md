*Note: This is a work-in-progress*

It was Raksha Bandhan this weekend, and I got to spend time with family. As I've grown older, I've started realising the grounding nature of spending time with family -- they are rare relationships in that they have been continuous in my life, and I can expect for for them to persist going forward.

I think my family is fairly intellectual, and oftentimes the dicussions turn to state matters and economics -- and I don't have much to contribute there. This time though, what stood out was how much AI was at the top of everybody's mind.

It's interesting because everyone is using it a lot in their lives, and yet we're strugging to see what is on the horizon as models get better, and a lot of us are fearing losing what makes us relevant in society.

The rhetoric around AI has become fairly FOMO-heavy, and I've been trying to figure out what to do about this major change.

The most interesting discussions I've heard have been from people outside the hype cycle of AI company CEOs and LinkedIn influencers. 

They've been from Ethan Mollick, a professor studying innovation, and Mike Schindler, a UX Designer working at a development consultancy. Oh designers, how much I've missed you.

I've been going through them, and will gradually update this post with quotes, and try to pull together the themes into a coherent vision for a more humanist vision for AI.
