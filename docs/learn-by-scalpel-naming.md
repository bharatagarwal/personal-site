# Naming: "Learn by Scalpel"

Decision: **Learn by Scalpel**

## Candidates

1. **The Editor's Cut** — double meaning (editorial process + filmmaker's definitive version). Felt forced.
2. **Learn by Scalpel** — cutting into something that already exists, not building from nothing. Surgical, precise. **Chosen.**
3. **The Red Pen Method** — immediately signals editing. Everyone knows what a red pen means.
4. **The Markup** — technical (HTML markup, redlining docs) and editorial. Short.
5. **Draft Surgery** — the draft is the patient, edits are the procedure, understanding is the outcome.
6. **Reactive Learning** — counterpoint to generative learning (Feynman). Learning by reacting to material, not producing it.
